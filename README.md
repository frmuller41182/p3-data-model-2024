# Full Stack Web Development Project 3 - Data Model

This project simulates various scenarios in the financial services industry, including acquisitions, workforce shifts between industries, and market "manipulations". It leverages Prisma as an ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your application up and running:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```
$ bun install
```

### 2. Set up Database

Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file and launch the Docker container:

```
$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up -d
$ cd ..
```

the `-d` flag runs the containers in the background, so you will be able to keep using the terminal.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Ensure your .env file is set up correctly in the root directory of the project. It should include the correct database connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://frank:frank1234@localhost:5432/financeDB"
```

Replace frank:frank1234 with your username and password if different, and financeDB with your database name as necessary. Otherwise, if you leave the default values in the `docker-compose.yml` file you can use the URL above.

### 4. Set up Prisma

Run the following commands to set up Prisma. These commands generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your database, creating any necessary tables.

```
$ bunx prisma generate
$ bunx prisma db push
```

### 5. Seed the Database

To populate your database with initial data:

```
$ bunx prisma db seed
```

This step executes the seeding script defined in the prisma/seed.ts, which should populate your database with the initial required data. We even used some APIs to make the seeding data as realistic as possible!

### 6. Open Prisma Studio

In order to explore the data generated in the previous step, and to observe the changes produced by the scripts, it is strongly recommended to open Prisma Studio. You may do so by executing the following command:

```
$ bunx prisma studio
```

You can then open Prisma Studio in you web browser with the output URL.

## Play Around!!

This project includes scripts to simulate playful scenarios with the data generated in the `seed` command. Below are the explanations on what each of them do, as well as instructions on how to execute them:

### Market Manipulation

Ever wondered what it feels like to hold the power of the markets in your hands? Our Market Manipulation Script lets you play the role of a market wizard, imposing your will in the financial market this DB represents with just one command!

#### How does this work?

With this script you can either invoke a `Bull` or `Bear` event. The first will simulate a bull market scenario in which a random number of the companies listed will get a random yet generous increase in their stock price. The second one will simulate a market crash, which as you can guess, implies quite the opposite - a random number of companies listed gettig a random yet harsh decrease of their stock price.

To invoke your chosen scenario run the command below. You can specify if you want a `Bull` or `Bear` event by adding that word as a parameter:

```
$ bun manipulate-market -- "Bull"
$ bun manipulate-market -- "Bear"
```

If no parameter is provided, a random one will be selected.

### Corporate Carousel Script

Hold on to your seats, corporate adventurers! It's time to spin the Corporate Carousel and watch as employees hop on and off, riding from one industry to another in a thrilling exchange of talents and ties.

Simulate some dramatic scenarios in which a large proportion of the workforce of one indsutry, jumps off to work for companies in another industry. This script will make 30 to 60% of employees change their jobs! To run it execute the command below:

```
$bun industry-shift
```

The two affected industries will be selected at random, but you will see feedback on what happened in the terminal!

### The Acquisition Simulator

Welcome to the Acquisition Simulator. We avoid using the "Merge & Acquisition Simulator" name because, let's face it, mergers don't actually exist - only acquisitions reign supreme! ðŸ’° This script will allow you to simulate one company of your chosing buying another one. the acquiring company will:

1. Absorb 60% of the acquired company's employees.
2. Increase its stock price by a whopping 30% (because why not?).

The acquired company will (unfrotunately) be deleted from the listed companies. But don't worry, we'll make sure to create a fancy "Acquisition" event to commemorate this momentous occasion. To run the Acquisition Simulator you can run the command below and provide the two company's stock SYMBOL as the parameters. The first stock symbol will be the acquiring company, and the second one will be the acquired one:

```
$bun acquisition -- "AMZN GOOGL"
```

For example in the above command you would simulate Amazon buying Google. If no arguments are provided, the companies will be selected at random among the existing stocks.

### Delete All Data

We also want to give you flexibility to do a fresh restart!! Run the command below to delete all data from the database:

```
$ bun deleteAll
```
